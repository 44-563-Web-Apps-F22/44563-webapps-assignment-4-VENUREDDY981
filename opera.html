    <pre style = "word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap;">
        Zara:     Why, Arthur, what does it matter?  When the higher
        qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
        notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
        thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
        (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
        hand in his), you have that already!
      
        Fitz.:    How good and wise you are!  How unerringly your
        practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
        material from the merely incidental!
      
        Zara:     My Girton training, Arthur.  At Girton all is wheat, and
        idle chaff is never heard within its walls!  But tell me, is not
        all working marvelously well?  Have not our Flowers of Progress
        more than justified their name?
      
        Fitz.:    We have indeed done our best.  Captain Corcoran and I
        have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
        services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
        trembles at the name of Utopia!
      
        Zara:     How clever of you!
      
        Fitz.:    Clever?  Not a bit.  It's easy as possible when the
        Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere.  And so
        with the others.  Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
        idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
        full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
        never dreamt of!
      
        Zara:     But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
        ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
        that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
        applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
        man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
        restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
        christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
        Prospectus!
      
        Fitz.:    Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
        trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.
      
        Zara:     Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
        even to the costume of our people.  Discarding their own barbaric
        dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
        ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
        Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
        with clothing designed upon the most approved English
        models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
        things is to be held here this evening.
      
        Fitz.:    But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.
      
        Zara:     Ah, we've improved upon that.  We all look so much
        better by candlelight!  And when I tell you, dearest, that my
        Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am long-
        ing to go and try it on.
      
        Fitz.:    Then we must part?
      
        Zara:     Necessarily, for a time.
      
        Fitz.:    Just as I wanted to tell you, with all the passionate
        enthu-siasm of my nature, how deeply, how devotedly I love you!
      
        Zara:     Hush!  Are these the accents of a heart that really
        feels? True love does not indulge in declamation—its voice
        is sweet, and soft, and low.  The west wind whispers when he woos
        the poplars!
      
                            DUET — Zara and Fitzbattleaxe.
      
        Zara:          Words of love too loudly spoken
                            Ring their own untimely knell;
                       Noisy vows are rudely broken,
                            Soft the song of Philomel.
                       Whisper sweetly, whisper slowly,
                            Hour by hour and day by day;
                       Sweet and low as accents holy
                            Are the notes of lover's lay.
      
        Both:          Sweet and low, etc.
      
        Fitz:          Let the conqueror, flushed with glory,
                            Bid his noisy clarions bray;
                       Lovers tell their artless story
                            In a whispered virelay.
                       False is he whose vows alluring
                            Make the listening echoes ring;
                       Sweet and low when all-enduring
                            Are the songs that lovers sing!
      
        Both:          Sweet and low, etc.
      
        (Exit Zara. Enter King dressed as Field-Marshal.)
      
        King:     To a Monarch who has been accustomed to the uncontrolled
        use of his limbs, the costume of a British Field-Marshal is,
        perhaps, at first, a little cramping.  Are you sure that this is
        all right?  It's not a practical joke, is it?  No one has a keener
        sense of humor than I have, but the First Statutory Cabinet
        Council of Utopia Limited must be conduct-ed with dignity and
        impressiveness.  Now, where are the other five who signed the
        Articles of Association?
      
        Fitz.:    Sir, they are here.
      
        (Enter Lord Dramaleigh, Captain Corcoran, Sir Bailey Barre, Mr.
        Blushington, and Mr. Goldbury from different entrances.)
      
        King:     Oh!  (Addressing them)  Gentlemen, our daughter holds
        her first Drawing-Room in half an hour, and we shall have time to
        make our half-yearly report in the interval.  I am neces-sarily
        unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
        Council—perhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us in
        the way of doing the thing properly, and with due regard to the
        solemnity of the occasion.
      
        Lord D.:  Certainly—nothing simpler.  Kindly bring your
        chairs forward—His Majesty will, of course, preside.
      
        (They range their chairs across stage like Christy Minstrels.
        King sits center, Lord Dramaleigh on his left, Mr. Goldbury on his
        right, Captain Corcoran left of Lord Dramaleigh, Captain
        Fitzbattleaxe right of Mr. Goldbury, Mr. Blushington extreme
        right, Sir Bailey Barre extreme left.)
      
        King:     Like this?
      
        Lord D.:  Like this.
      
        King:     We take your word for it that this is all right.  You
        are not making fun of us?  This is in accordance with the prac-
        tice at the Court of St. James's?
      
        Lord D.:  Well, it is in accordance with the practice at the Court
        of St. James's Hall.
      
        King:     Oh! it seems odd, but never mind.
      
        SONG — King.
      
        Society has quite forsaken all her wicked courses. Which empties
        our police courts, and abolishes divorces.
      
        Chorus:   Divorce is nearly obsolete in England.
      
        King:     No tolerance we show to undeserving rank and splendour;
        For the higher his position is, the greater the offender.
      
        Chorus:   That's a maxim that is prevalent in England.
      
        King:     No peeress at our drawing-room before the Presence
        passes Who wouldn't be accepted by the lower middle-classes. Each
        shady dame, whatever be her rank, is bowed out neatly.
      
        Chorus:   In short, this happy country has been Anglicized
        completely Is really is surprising What a thorough Anglicizing We
        have brought about—Utopia's quite another land; In her
        enterprising movements, She is England—with improvements,
        Which we dutifully offer to our mother-land!
      
        King:     Our city we have beautified—we've done it willy-
        nilly— And all that isn't Belgrave Square is Strand and
        Piccadilly.
      
        Chorus:        We haven't any slummeries in England!
      
        King:     The chamberlain our native stage has purged beyond a
        question. Of "risky" situation and indelicate suggestion; No piece
        is tolerated if it's costumed indiscreetly—
      
        Chorus:        In short this happy country has been Anglicized
        com-pletely! It really is surprising, etc.
      
        King:     Our peerage we've remodelled on an intellectual basis,
        Which certainly is rough on our hereditary races—
      
        Chorus:        We are going to remodel it in England.
      
        King:     The Brewers and the Cotton Lords no longer seek
        admission, And literary merit meets with proper recognition—
      
        Chorus:        As literary merit does in England!
      
        King:     Who knows but we may count among our intellectual
        chickens, Like you, an Earl of Thackery and p'r'aps a Duke of
        Dickens— Lord Fildes and Viscount Millais (when they come)
        we'll welcome sweetly—
      
        Chorus:   In short, this happy country has been Anglicized
        completely! It really is surprising, etc.
      
        (At the end all rise and replace their chairs.)
      
        King:     Now, then, for our first Drawing-Room.  Where are the
        Prin-cesses?  What an extraordinary thing it is that since Euro-
        pean looking-glasses have been supplied to the Royal bed-rooms my
        daughters are invariably late!
      
        Lord D.:  Sir, their Royal Highnesses await your pleasure in the
        Ante-room.
      
        King:     Oh.  Then request them to do us the favor to enter at
        once.
      
        (Enter all the Royal Household, including (besides the Lord
        Chamber-lain) the Vice-Chamberlain, the Master of the Horse, the
        Master of the Buckhounds, the Lord High Treasurer, the Lord
        Steward, the Comptroller of the Household, the Lord-in-Waiting,
        the Field Officer in Brigade Waiting, the Gold and Silver Stick,
        and the Gentlemen Ushers.  Then enter the three Princesses (their
        trains carried by Pages of Honor), Lady Sophy, and the Ladies-in-
        Waiting.)
      
        King:     My daughters, we are about to attempt a very solemn
        ceremo-nial, so no giggling, if you please.  Now, my Lord Chamber-
        lain, we are ready.
      
        Lord D.:  Then, ladies and gentlemen, places, if you please.  His
        Maj-esty will take his place in front of the throne, and will be
        so obliging as to embrace all the debutantes.  (LADY SOPHY much
        shocked.)
      
        King:     What—must I really?
      
        Lord D.:  Absolutely indispensable.
      
        King:     More jam for the Palace Peeper!
      
        (The King takes his place in front of the throne, the Princess
        Zara on his left, the two younger Princesses on the left of Zara.)
      
        King:     Now, is every one in his place?
      
        Lord D.:  Every one is in his place.
      
        King:     Then let the revels commence.
      
        (Enter the ladies attending the Drawing-Room.  They give their
        cards to the Groom-in-Waiting, who passes them to the Lord-in-
        Waiting, who passes them to the Vice-Chamberlain, who passes them
        to the Lord Chamberlain, who reads the names to the King as each
        lady approaches.  The ladies curtsey in succession to the King and
        the three Princesses, and pass out.  When all the presentations
        have been accomplished, the King, Princesses, and Lady Sophy come
        forward, and all the ladies re-enter.)
      
                                  RECITATIVE — King
      
                  This ceremonial our wish displays
                  To copy all Great Britain's courtly ways.
                  Though lofty aims catastrophe entail,
                  We'll gloriously succeed or nobly fail!
      
                              UNACCOMPANIED CHORUS
      
                  Eagle High in Cloudland soaring—
                       Sparrow twittering on a reed—
                  Tiger in the jungle roaring—
                       Frightened fawn in grassy mead—
                  Let the eagle, not the sparrow,
                  Be the object of your arrow—
                       Fix the tiger with your eye—
                       Pass the fawn in pity by.
                       Glory then will crown the day—
                       Glory, glory, anyway!
      
                                                                     (Exit all.)
      
        Enter Scaphio and Phantis, now dressed as judges in red and ermine
        robes and undress wigs.  They come down stage melodramatically
        — working together.
      
                             DUET — Scaphio and Phantis.
      
        Sca.:               With fury deep we burn
      
        Phan.:                                            We do—
      
        Sca.:               We fume with smothered rage—
      
        Phan.:                                            We do—
      
        Sca.:               These Englishmen who rule supreme,
                            Their undertaking they redeem
                            By stifling every harmless scheme
                                 In which we both engage—
      
        Phan.:                                            They do—
      
        Sca.:                    In which we both engage—
      
        Phan.:              We think it is our turn—
      
        Sca.:                                             We do—
      
        Phan.:              We think our turn has come—
      
        Sca.:                                             We do.
      
        Phan.:              These Englishmen, they must prepare
                            To seek at once their native air.
                            The King as heretofore, we swear,
                            Shall be beneath our thumb—
      
        Sca.:                                             He shall—
      
        Phan.:              Shall be beneath out thumb—
      
        Sca.:                                             He shall.
      
        Both: (with great energy)
                            For this mustn't be, and this won't do.
                            If you'll back me, then I'll back you,
                                      No, this won't do,
                                      No, this mustn't be.
                               With fury deep we burn...
      
                                    Enter the King.
      
        King:     Gentlemen, gentlemen—really!  This unseemly
        display of energy within the Royal precincts is altogether
        unpardon-able.  Pray, what do you complain of?
      
        Scaphio:  (furiously)  What do we complain of?  Why, through the
        innovations introduced by the Flowers of Progress all our harmless
        schemes for making a provision for our old age are ruined.  Our
        Matrimonial Agency is at a standstill, our Cheap Sherry business
        is in bankruptcy, our Army Clothing contracts are paralyzed, and
        even our Society paper, the Palace Peeper, is practically defunct!
      
        King:     Defunct?  Is that so?  Dear, dear, I am truly sorry.
      
        Scaphio:  Are you aware that Sir Bailey Barre has introduced a law
        of libel by which all editors of scurrilous newspapers are pub-
        licly flogged—as in England?  And six of our editors have
        resigned in succession!  Now, the editor of a scurrilous paper can
        stand a good deal—he takes a private thrashing as a matter
        of course—it's considered in his salary—but no
        gentleman likes to be publicly flogged.
      
        King:     Naturally.  I shouldn't like it myself.
      
        Phantis:  Then our Burlesque Theater is absolutely ruined!
      
        King:     Dear me.  Well, theatrical property is not what it was.
      
        Phantis:  Are you aware that the Lord Chamberlain, who has his own
        views as to the best means of elevating the national drama, has
        declined to license any play that is not in blank verse and three
        hundred years old—as in England?
      
        Scaphio:  And as if that wasn't enough, the County Councillor has
        or-dered a four-foot wall to be built up right across the
        proscenium, in case of fire—as in England.
      
        Phantis:  It's so hard on the company—who are liable to be
        roasted alive—and this has to be met by enormously increased
        salaries—as in England.
      
        Scaphio:  You probably know that we've contracted to supply the
        entire nation with a complete English outfit.  But perhaps you do
        not know that, when we send in our bills, our customers plead
        liability limited to a declared capital of eighteenpence, and
        apply to be dealt with under the Winding-up Act—as in
        England?
      
        King:     Really, gentlemen, this is very irregular.  If you will
        be so good as to formulate a detailed list of your grievances in
        writing, addressed to the Secretary of Utopia Limited, they will
        be laid before the Board, in due course, at their next monthly
        meeting.
      
        Scaphio:  Are we to understand that we are defied?
      
        King:     That is the idea I intended to convey.
      
        Phantis:  Defied!  We are defied!
      
        Scaphio:  (furiously)  Take care—you know our powers.
        Trifle with us, and you die!
      
                          TRIO — Scaphio, Phantis, and King.
      
        Sca.:     If you think that, when banded in unity,
                  We may both be defied with impunity,
                       You are sadly misled of a verity!
      
        Phan.:    If you value repose and tranquility,
                  You'll revert to a state of docility,
                       Or prepare to regret your temerity!
      
        King.:    If my speech is unduly refractory
                  You will find it a course satisfactory
                       At an early Board meeting to show it up.
                  Though if proper excuse you can trump any,
                  You may wind up a Limited Company,
                       You cannot conveniently blow it up!
      
                    (Scaphio and Phantis thoroughly baffled)
      
        King.:  (Dancing quietly)
                  Whene'er I chance to baffle you
                  I, also, dance a step or two—
                  Of this now guess the hidden sense:
      
        (Scaphio and Phantis consider the question as King continues
        dancing quietly—then give it up.)
      
                  It means complete indifference!
      
        Sca. and Phan.:     Of course it does—indifference!
                            It means complete indifference!
      
        (King dancing quietly. Sca. and Phan. dancing furiously.)
      
        Sca. and Phan.:     As we've a dance for every mood
                            With pas de trois we will conclude,
                            What this may mean you all may guess—
                            It typifies remorselessness!
      
        King.:              It means unruffled cheerfulness!
      
        (King dances off placidly as Scaphio and Phantis dance furiously.)
      
        Phantis:  (breathless)  He's right—we are helpless!  He's no
        longer a human being—he's a Corporation, and so long as he
        confines himself to his Articles of Association we can't touch
        him! What are we to do?
      
        Scaphio:  Do?  Raise a Revolution, repeal the Act of Sixty-Two,
        recon-vert him into an individual, and insist on his immediate ex-
        plosion!  (Tarara enters.)  Tarara, come here; you're the very man
        we want.
      
        Tarara:   Certainly, allow me.  (Offers a cracker to each; they
        snatch them away impatiently.)  That's rude.
      
        Scaphio:  We have no time for idle forms.  You wish to succeed to
        the throne?
      
        Tarara:   Naturally.
      
        Scaphio:  Then you won't unless you join us.  The King has defied
        us, and, as matters stand, we are helpless.  So are you.  We must
        devise some plot at once to bring the people about his ears.
      
        Tarara:   A plot?
      
        Phantis:  Yes, a plot of superhuman subtlety.  Have you such a
        thing about you?
      
        Tarara:   (feeling)  No, I think not.  No.  There's one on my
        dressing-table.
      
        Scaphio:  We can't wait—we must concoct one at once, and put
        it into execution without delay.  There is not a moment to spare!
      
                         TRIO — Scaphio, Phantis, and Tarara.
      
                                    Ensemble
      
                       With wily brain upon the spot
                            A private plot we'll plan,
                       The most ingenious private plot
                            Since private plots began.
                       That's understood. So far we've got
                       And, striking while the iron's hot,
                       We'll now determine like a shot
                       The details of this private plot.
      
        Sca.:          I think we ought—(whispers)
        Phan. and Tar.:     Such bosh I never heard!
        Phan.:         Ah! happy thought!—(whispers)
        Sca. and Tar.:      How utterly dashed absurd!
        Tar.:          I'll tell you how—(whispers)
        Sca and Phan.:      Why, what put that in your head?
        Sca.:          I've got it now—(whispers)
        Phan. and Tar.:     Oh, take him away to bed!
        Phan.:         Oh, put him to bed!
        Tar.:          Oh, put him to bed!
        Sca.:               What, put me to bed?
        Phan. and Tar.:     Yes, certainly put him to bed!
        Sca.:          But, bless me, don't you see—
        Phan.:              Do listen to me, I pray—
        Tar.:          It certainly seems to me—
        Sca.:               Bah—this is the only way!
        Phan.:         It's rubbish absurd you growl!
        Tar.:          You talk ridiculous stuff!
        Sca.:          You're a drivelling barndoor owl!
        Phan.:              You're a vapid and vain old muff!
      
                        (All, coming down to audience.)
      
                  So far we haven't quite solved the plot—
                  They're not a very ingenious lot—
                       But don't be unhappy,
                       It's still on the tapis,
                  We'll presently hit on a capital plot!
      
        Sca.:     Suppose we all—(whispers)
        Phan.:         Now there I think you're right.
                  Then we might all—(whispers)
        Tar.:          That's true, we certainly might.
                  I'll tell you what—(whispers)
        Sca.:          We will if we possibly can.
                  Then on the spot— (whispers)
        Phan. and Tar.:     Bravo!  A capital plan!
        Sca.:     That's exceedingly neat and new!
        Phan.:    Exceedingly new and neat.
        Tar.:     I fancy that that will do.
        Sca.:          It's certainly very complete.
        Phan.:    Well done you sly old sap!
        Tar.:          Bravo, you cunning old mole!
        Sca.:     You very ingenious chap!
        Phan.:         You intellectual soul!
      
                  (All, coming down and addressing audience.)
      
                  At last a capital plan we've got
                  We won't say how and we won't say what:
                       It's safe in my noddle—
                       Now off we will toddle,
                  And slyly develop this capital plot!
      
        (Business.  Exeunt Scaphio and Phantis in one direction, and
        Tarara in the other.)
      
        (Enter Lord Dramaleigh and Mr. Goldbury.)
      
        Lord D.:  Well, what do you think of our first South Pacific
        Drawing-Room?  Allowing for a slight difficulty with the trains,
        and a little want of familiarity with the use of the rouge-pot, it
        was, on the whole, a meritorious affair?
      
        Gold.:    My dear Dramaleigh, it redounds infinitely to your
        credit.
      
        Lord D.:  One or two judicious innovations, I think?
      
        Gold.:    Admirable.  The cup of tea and the plate of mixed
        biscuits were a cheap and effective inspiration.
      
        Lord D.:  Yes—my idea entirely.  Never been done before.
      
        Gold.:    Pretty little maids, the King's youngest daughters, but
        timid.
      
        Lord D.:  That'll wear off.  Young.
      
        Gold.:    That'll wear off.  Ha! here they come, by George!  And
        with-out the Dragon!  What can they have done with her?
      
        (Enter Nekaya and Kalyba timidly.)
      
        Nekaya:   Oh, if you please, Lady Sophy has sent us in here,
        because Zara and Captain Fitzbattleaxe are going on, in the
        garden, in a manner which no well-conducted young ladies ought to
        witness.
      
        Lord D.:  Indeed, we are very much obliged to her Ladyship.
      
        Kalyba:   Are you?  I wonder why.
      
        Nekaya:   Don't tell us if it's rude.
      
        Lord D.:  Rude?  Not at all.  We are obliged to Lady Sophy because
        she has afforded us the pleasure of seeing you.
      
        Nekaya:   I don't think you ought to talk to us like that.
      
        Kalyba:   It's calculated to turn our heads.
      
        Nekaya:   Attractive girls cannot be too particular.
      
        Kalyba:   Oh pray, pray do not take advantage of our unprotected
        inno-cence.
      
        Gold.:    Pray be reassured—you are in no danger whatever.
      
        Lord D.:  But may I ask—is this extreme delicacy—this
        shrinking sensitiveness—a general characteristic of Utopian
        young ladies?
      
        Nekaya:   Oh no; we are crack specimens.
      
        Kalyba:   We are the pick of the basket.  Would you mind not
        coming quite so near?  Thank you.
      
        Nekaya:   And please don't look at us like that; it unsettles us.
      
        Kalyba:   And we don't like it.  At least, we do like it; but it's
        wrong.
      
        Nekaya:   We have enjoyed the inestimable privilege of being
        educated by a most refined and easily shocked English lady, on the
        very strictest English principles.
      
        Gold.:    But, my dear young ladies—-
      
        Kalyba:   Oh, don't!  You mustn't.  It's too affectionate.
      
        Nekaya:   It really does unsettle us.
      
        Gold.:    Are you really under the impression that English girls
        are so ridiculously demure?  Why, an English girl of the highest
        type is the best, the most beautiful, the bravest, and the
        brightest creature that Heaven has conferred upon this world of
        ours.  She is frank, open-hearted, and fearless, and never shows
        in so favorable a light as when she gives her own blameless
        impulses full play!
      
        Nekaya    Oh, you shocking story! and Kalyba:
      
        Gold.:    Not at all.  I'm speaking the strict truth.  I'll tell
        you all about her.
      
                                 SONG — Mr. Goldbury.
      
                  A wonderful joy our eyes to bless,
                  In her magnificent comeliness,
                  Is an English girl of eleven stone two,
                  And five foot ten in her dancing shoe!
                       She follows the hounds, and on she pounds—
                            The "field" tails off and the muffs diminish—
      
                  Over the hedges and brooks she bounds,
                       Straight as a crow, from find to finish.
                  At cricket, her kin will lose or win—
                       She and her maids, on grass and clover,
                  Eleven maids out—eleven maids in—
                       And perhaps an occasional "maiden over!"
      
                       Go search the world and search the sea,
                       Then come you home and sing with me
                       There's no such gold and no such pearl
                       As a bright and beautiful English girl!
      
                  With a ten-mile spin she stretches her limbs,
                  She golfs, she punts, she rows, she swims—
                  She plays, she sings, she dances, too,
                  From ten or eleven til all is blue!
                       At ball or drum, til small hours come
                            (Chaperon's fans concealing her yawning)
                       She'll waltz away like a teetotum.
                            And never go home til daylight's dawning.
                       Lawn-tennis may share her favours fair—
                            Her eyes a-dance, and her cheeks a-glowing—
                       Down comes her hair, but then what does she care?
                            It's all her own and it's worth the showing!
                                 Go search the world, etc.
      
                  Her soul is sweet as the ocean air,
                  For prudery knows no haven there;
                  To find mock-modesty, please apply
                  To the conscious blush and the downcast eye.
                       Rich in the things contentment brings,
                            In every pure enjoyment wealthy,
                       Blithe and beautiful bird she sings,
                            For body and mind are hale and healthy.
                       Her eyes they thrill with right goodwill—
                            Her heart is light as a floating feather—
                       As pure and bright as the mountain rill
                            That leaps and laughs in the Highland heather!
                                 Go search the world, etc.
      
                                    QUARTET
      
        Nek.:          Then I may sing and play?
      
        Lord D.:                                You may!
      
        Kal.:          Then I may laugh and shout?
      
        Gold.:                                  No doubt!.
      
        Nek.:          These maxims you endorse?
      
        Lord D.:                                Of course!
      
        Kal.:          You won't exclaim "Oh fie!"
      
        Gold.:                                  Not I!
      
        Gold:          Whatever you are—be that:
                            Whatever you say—be true:
                                      Straightforwardly act—
                                 Be honest—in fact,
                            Be nobody else but you.
      
        Lord D.:       Give every answer pat—
                            Your character true unfurl;
                                 And when it is ripe,
                                 You'll then be a type
                            Of a capital English girl.
      
        All.:          Oh sweet surprise—oh, dear delight,
                       To find it undisputed quite,
                       All musty, fusty rules despite
                       That Art is wrong and Nature right!
      
        Nek.:          When happy I,
                            With laughter glad
                                 I'll wake the echoes fairly,
                       And only sigh
                            When I am sad—
                                 And that will be but rarely!
      
        Kal.:          I'll row and fish,
                            And gallop, soon—
                                 No longer be a prim one—
                       And when I wish
                            To hum a tune,
                                 It needn't be a hymn one?
      
        Gold and Lord D.: No, no!
                       It needn't be a hymn one!
      
        All (dancing): Oh, sweet surprise and dear delight
                       To find it undisputed quite—
                       All musty, fusty rules despite—
                       That Art is wrong and Nature right!
      
                                                              (Dance, and off)
                               (Enter Lady Sophy)
      
                               RECITATIVE — Lady Sophy.
      
                  Oh, would some demon power the gift impart
                  To quell my over-conscientious heart—
                  Unspeak the oaths that never had been spoken,
                  And break the vows that never should be broken!
      
                               SONG — Lady Sophy
      
                  When but a maid of fifteen year,
                       Unsought—unplighted—
                  Short petticoated—and, I fear,
                       Still shorter-sighted—
                  I made a vow, one early spring,
                  That only to some spotless King
                  Who proof of blameless life could bring
                       I'd be united.
                  For I had read, not long before,
                  Of blameless kings in fairy lore,
                  And thought the race still flourished here—
                       Well, well—
                     I was a maid of fifteen year!
      
        (The King enters and overhears this verse)
      
                  Each morning I pursued my game
                       (An early riser);
                  For spotless monarchs I became
                       An advertiser:
                  But all in vain I searched each land,
                  So, kingless, to my native strand
                  Returned, a little older, and
                       A good deal wiser!
      
                  I learnt that spotless King and Prince
                  Have disappeared some ages since—
                  Even Paramount's angelic grace—
                            Ah me!—
                  Is but a mask on Nature's face!
        (King comes forward)
      
        King:     Ah, Lady Sophy—then you love me!
                       For so you sing—
      
        Lady S.: (Indignant and surprise. Producing "Palace Peeper")
                       No, by the stars that shine above me,
                            Degraded King!
                  For while these rumours, through the city bruited,
                  Remain uncontradicted, unrefuted,
                  The object thou of my aversion rooted,
                            Repulsive thing!
      
        King:     Be just—the time is now at hand
                       When truth may published be.
                  These paragraphs were written and
                       Contributed by me!
      
        Lady S.: By you?  No, no!
      
        King:                         Yes, yes. I swear, by me!
                  I, caught in Scaphio's ruthless toil,
                       Contributed the lot!
      
        Lady S.:  That that is why you did not boil
                       The author on the spot!
      
        King:     And that is why I did not boil
                       The author on the spot!
      
        Lady S.:  I couldn't think why you did not boil!
      
        King:     But I know why I did not boil
                       The author on the spot!
      
                          DUET — Lady Sophy and King
      
        Lady S.:  Oh, the rapture unrestrained
                       Of a candid retractation!
                  For my sovereign has deigned
                       A convincing explanation—
                  And the clouds that gathered o'er
                       All have vanished in the distance,
                  And of Kings of fairy lore
                       One, at least, is in existence!
      
        King:     Oh, the skies are blue above,
                       And the earth is red and rosal,
                  Now the lady of my love
                       Has accepted my proposal!
                  For that asinorum pons
                       I have crossed without assistance,
                  And of prudish paragons
                       One, at least, is in existence!
      
        (King and Lady Sophy dance gracefully.  While this is going on
        Lord Dramaleigh enters unobserved with Nekaya and Capt.
        Fitzbattleaxe.  The two girls direct Zara's attention to the King
        and Lady Sophy, who are still dancing affectionately together.  At
        this point the King kisses Lady Sophy, which causes the Princesses
        to make an exclamation.  The King and Lady Sophy are at first much
        confused at being detected, but eventually throw off all reserve,
        and the four couples break into a wild Tarantella, and at the end
        exeunt severally.)
      
        Enter all the male Chorus, in great excitement, from various
        entrances, led by Scaphio, Phantis, and Tarara, and followed by
        the female Chorus.</pre>
